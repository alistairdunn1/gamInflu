Title: Influence Analysis for Generalized Additive Models
Version: 0.1
Author: Alistair Dunn [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Alistair Dunn <alistair.dunn@OceanEnvironmental.co.nz>
Description: Influence analysis tools for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) fitted with mgcv. 
    Supports smoother types including s(), te(), ti(), t2(), and by= terms. 
    Generates stepwise index plots, term influence plots, and coefficient-distribution-influence (CDI) plots to help understand model structure and the influence of each term.
    This package is inspired by and builds upon concepts from Bentley, N.; Kendrick, T. H.; Starr, P. J.; Breen, P. A. Influence Plots and Metrics: Tools for Better Understanding Fisheries Catch-per-Unit-Effort Standardizations. ICES Journal of Marine Science 2012, 69(1), 84â€“88 pp.
