\usage{
r2_contribution(obj, r2_type = c("r2Dev", "r2Negel", "r2"))

\method{r2_contribution}{influence_gam}(obj, r2_type = c("r2Dev", "r2Negel", "r2"))
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class `influence_gam` with calculated results.}

\item{r2_type}{The type of R-squared to use for calculating contributions.
Options are `"r2Dev"` (Deviance Explained, default), `"r2Negel"` (Negelkerke R2),
or `"r2"` (Correlation-based R2).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns `term` and `r2_contribution`.
}
\description{
Calculates the approximate contribution of each term to the model's R-squared
based on the sequential fitting performed during `calculate_influence`.
}
