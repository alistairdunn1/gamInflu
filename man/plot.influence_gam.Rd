\usage{
\method{plot}{influence_gam}(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  type = c("stan", "step", "influ", "cdi", "step_influ", "interaction"),
  term = NULL,
  panels = TRUE,
  labels = list(),
  base_size = 11,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `influence_gam` with calculated results.}

\item{y}{Ignored. Included for compatibility with the generic plot function.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to generate. Options are:
`"stan"`: Standardization plot (unstandardised vs standardised index).
`"step"`: Step plot showing index changes as terms are added.
`"influ"`: Influence plot showing the effect of each non-focus term across focus levels.
`"cdi"`: Coefficient-Distribution-Influence plot (EXPERIMENTAL for GAMs).
`"step_influ"`: Side-by-side step and influence plots (using patchwork).
`"interaction"`: Plot for visualizing two-way factor interaction terms.}

\item{term}{For `type = "cdi"` or `type = "interaction"`, the specific model term (character string) to plot.}

\item{panels}{For `type = "step"` or `type = "influ"`, should plots be panelled (TRUE, using facets) or overlaid (FALSE)?}

\item{labels}{A named list to override default axis labels (e.g., `list(focus = "Year", term = "Effort")`). Names should match focus variable or term names.}

\item{base_size}{Base font size for ggplot theme.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (passed to helper functions or underlying methods, currently less used).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (for single plots) or a patchwork object (for combined plots like cdi, step_influ).
}
\description{
Generates various diagnostic plots for influence analysis results from a
`influence_gam` object using the `ggplot2` package.
