Title: Influence Analysis for Generalized Additive Models
Version: 0.1
Author: Alistair Dunn [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Alistair Dunn <alistair.dunn@OceanEnvironmental.co.nz>
Description: Comprehensive influence analysis tools for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) fitted with mgcv. 
    Enhanced with multi-family support for Gaussian, binomial, gamma, and Poisson distributions.
    Supports all smoother types including s(), te(), ti(), t2(), and by= terms. 
    Generates stepwise index plots, term influence plots, coefficient-distribution-influence (CDI) plots, 
    and family-specific standardized indices to help understand model structure and term influences.
    Features automatic family detection, family-appropriate statistical methods, and comprehensive 
    visualization tools for fisheries CPUE standardization and ecological modeling.
    This package is inspired by and builds upon concepts from Bentley, N.; Kendrick, T. H.; Starr, P. J.; Breen, P. A. Influence Plots and Metrics: Tools for Better Understanding Fisheries Catch-per-Unit-Effort Standardizations. ICES Journal of Marine Science 2012, 69(1), 84-88 pp.
