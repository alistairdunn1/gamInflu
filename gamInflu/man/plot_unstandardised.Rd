\title{Unstandardised Index Plot with Boxplots}
\usage{
plot_unstandardised(obj, show_standardised = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object containing calculated indices from `calculate_influence()`.}

\item{show_standardised}{Logical. Should the standardised index be displayed as an overlay? Default is TRUE.
When TRUE, adds a line and confidence ribbon showing the rescaled standardised index for comparison.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing:
  - Boxplots: Distribution of raw observations by focus term level (typically year)
  - Rescaled standardised index line (blue): Model-adjusted values rescaled to match unstandardised mean (if show_standardised = TRUE)
  - Confidence ribbon (light blue): Uncertainty bounds around rescaled standardised index (if show_standardised = TRUE)
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing the raw year effect as boxplots by year, with an optional 
overlay of the standardised index as a line with confidence interval ribbon. The standardised 
index is rescaled to have the same mean as the unstandardised data for direct comparison.
}
\details{
This plot provides insight into the raw data distribution within each level of the focus term
(typically years) and how the model's standardised index relates to this underlying variability.

The boxplots show:
- Median (centre line)
- Quartiles (box boundaries) 
- Whiskers (1.5 × IQR)
- Outliers (points beyond whiskers)

The standardised index overlay is rescaled to have the same mean as the unstandardised data,
allowing direct visual comparison between the raw data patterns and the model-derived trend.
The x-axis uses a numeric sequence for clean display regardless of the focus term values.

Rescaling formula: rescaled_index = standardised_index * (mean(unstandardised) / mean(standardised))
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage - shows boxplots with rescaled standardised overlay
gi <- gam_influence(your_model, focus = "year")
gi <- calculate_influence(gi)
plot_unstandardised(gi)

# Show only boxplots without standardised overlay
plot_unstandardised(gi, show_standardised = FALSE)

# Compare patterns between raw data and rescaled model trend
plot_unstandardised(gi, show_standardised = TRUE)
}
