\title{Generic Plot Method for gam_influence Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{gam_influence}(x, type = "all", ...)

plot_term_influence(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `gam_influence` object that has been processed by `calculate_influence()`.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to generate. Can be one of:
- `"stan"`: Standardisation plot.
- `"step"`: Step plot.
- `"influ"`: Influence plot.
- `"cdi"`: Coefficient-Distribution-Influence plot (requires `term` argument).
- `"distribution"`: Data distribution plot for a specific term (requires `term` argument).
- `"all"`: A combined layout of the step and influence plots.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific plot functions (e.g., `term` for cdi and distribution).}

\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object containing calculated indices.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object or a patchwork object for combined plots.

A ggplot object showing the influence of each non-focus term.
}
\description{
Dispatches to specific plotting functions based on the `type` argument. This
is the primary user-facing function for creating visualisations.

Creates an influence plot showing the influence of each non-focus term on the focus term's index.

\section{Functions}{
