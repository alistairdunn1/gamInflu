\title{Generic Plot Method for 'gam_influence' Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{gam_influence}(x, type = "all", ...)

plot_cdi(obj, term, re_type = "points")

plot_standardisation(obj)

plot_step_and_influence(obj)

plot_term_influence(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `gam_influence` object that has been processed by `calculate_influence()`.}

\item{type}{The type of plot to generate. Can be one of:
- `"stan"`: Standardisation plot.
- `"step"`: Step plot.
- `"influ"`: Influence plot.
- `"cdi"`: Coefficient-Distribution-Influence plot (requires `term` argument).
- `"all"`: A combined layout of the step and influence plots.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific plot functions (e.g., `term` for cdi).}

\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object containing calculated indices.}

\item{term}{The character name of the model term to plot (e.g., `"s(temp)"`). Alternatively, it can be a numeric index of the term in the model. If a numeric index is provided, it will be converted to the corresponding term name.}

\item{re_type}{Character; for random effects, one of "points", "qq", "hist", or "caterpillar".}
}
\value{
A ggplot object or a patchwork object for combined plots.

A patchwork ggplot object.

A ggplot object showing both unstandardised and standardised indices, with confidence ribbon.

A patchwork plot combining the stepwise index and term influence plots.

A ggplot object showing the influence of each non-focus term.
}
\description{
Dispatches to specific plotting functions based on the `type` argument. This
is the primary user-facing function for creating visualizations.

Creates a standardisation plot comparing the unstandardised (raw) index to the final standardised index for the focus term.

Creates a combined plot showing both the stepwise index and term influence for a `gam_influence` object.

Creates an influence plot showing the influence of each non-focus term on the focus term's index.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{plot_cdi()}: Creates a Coefficient-Distribution-Influence (CDI) plot.
This is a multi-panel plot that visualizes a term's effect, its data
distribution, and its influence on the focus term.

\item \code{plot_standardisation()}: Creates a standardisation plot.

\item \code{plot_step_and_influence()}: Creates a combined step and influence plot.

\item \code{plot_term_influence()}: Creates an influence plot.
Shows the influence of each non-focus term on the focus term's index.
