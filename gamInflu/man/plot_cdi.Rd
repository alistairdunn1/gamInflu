\title{CDI Plot for GAM Terms}
\usage{
plot_cdi(x, term, variable = NULL, type = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A gam_influence object with calculations performed}

\item{term}{The smooth term to plot (from expanded terms)}

\item{variable}{Optional variable name if it can't be inferred from term}

\item{type}{Optional type of plot (e.g., "coefficients", "distribution", "influence", or "all")}

\item{...}{Additional plotting arguments}
}
\value{
A combined ggplot object
}
\description{
Create a Coefficient-Distribution-Influence plot for a smooth term's
influence on the parametric focus term. The plot consists of three panels:
\itemize{
  \item Top panel: Coefficients/effects of the plotted term
  \item Bottom left: Distribution of observations across term levels vs focus levels
  \item Bottom right: Standardized influence scores (mean = 1)
}
}
