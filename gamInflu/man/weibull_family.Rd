\title{Custom Weibull Family for GAM}
\usage{
weibull_family(link = "log")
}
\arguments{
\item{link}{Character string specifying the link function. Default is "log" which is
the canonical link for Weibull scale parameter.}
}
\value{
A family object suitable for use with mgcv::gam
}
\description{
fam$family <- "quasi"  # Keep mgcv-recognised nametion Creates a custom Weibull family for use with mgcv::gam. This family is designed
for positive continuous data following a Weibull distribution, commonly used in survival
analysis and reliability modeling.
}
\details{
The Weibull distribution has two parameters: shape (k) and scale (lambda). This family
models the scale parameter through the linear predictor using the specified link function.
The shape parameter is estimated as a nuisance parameter.

**Supported Links:**
- **log**: Canonical link ensuring positive scale parameter (recommended)
- **identity**: Direct modeling of scale parameter (use with caution)

**Data Requirements:**
- Response must be positive continuous values
- Suitable for duration, time-to-event, and reliability data

# Generate Weibull data

# Fit Weibull GAM
model <- gam(y ~ s(x) + year, family = weibull_family(), data = data)

# Use with gamInflu
gi <- gam_influence(model, focus = "year", data = data)
