\usage{
plot_terms(obj, term = NULL, re_type = "points", cdi = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object containing calculated predictions and standard errors.}

\item{term}{The character name of the model term to plot (e.g., `"s(temp)"`). Alternatively, it can
be a numeric index of the term in the model. If a numeric index is provided, it will be converted
to the corresponding term name. If `NULL`, all terms will be plotted.}

\item{re_type}{Character; for random effects, one of "points", "qq", "hist", or "caterpillar".}

\item{cdi}{Logical; if TRUE, use CDI plot style.}

A ggplot object (or patchwork if multiple terms).

\description{

including by-variable panels and random effects.
