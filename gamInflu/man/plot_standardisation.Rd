\title{Standardisation Plot}
\usage{
plot_standardisation(obj, show_unstandardised = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object containing calculated indices from `calculate_influence()`.}

\item{show_unstandardised}{Logical. Should the unstandardised index be displayed? Default is TRUE.
When FALSE, only the standardised index is shown and the legend is hidden for a cleaner plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing both unstandardised and standardised indices, with confidence ribbon
  around the standardised index. The plot includes:
  - Unstandardised index (grey line and points): Raw aggregated values by focus level (if show_unstandardised = TRUE)
  - Standardised index (blue line and points): Model-adjusted values accounting for all terms
  - Confidence ribbon (light blue): Uncertainty bounds around the standardised index
  - Reference line at y=1: Baseline for relative comparison
}
\description{
Creates a standardisation plot comparing the unstandardised (raw) index to the final
standardised index for the focus term. Works with all supported GLM families (Gaussian, binomial,
gamma, Poisson) and displays family-appropriate confidence intervals.
}
\details{
The standardisation plot visualizes the effect of model standardisation on the focus term index.
The unstandardised index shows the raw relationship, while the standardised index accounts for
all other model terms and their interactions.

**Family-specific behaviour:**
- **Gaussian**: Traditional CPUE-style indices with geometric/arithmetic mean aggregation
- **Binomial**: Probability-based indices for presence/absence data
- **Gamma**: Positive continuous indices using geometric mean methods
- **Poisson**: Count-based indices with appropriate statistical methods

The confidence intervals are calculated using the specified confidence level from
`calculate_influence()` (default 95%) and reflect the uncertainty in the model predictions.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage - shows both standardised and unstandardised
gi <- gam_influence(your_model, focus = "year")
gi <- calculate_influence(gi)
plot_standardisation(gi)

# Show only standardised index for cleaner presentation
plot_standardisation(gi, show_unstandardised = FALSE)

# With different families
# Binomial model
gi_binom <- calculate_influence(gi_binomial_model)
plot_standardisation(gi_binom) # Shows probability indices

# Gamma model - standardised only
gi_gamma <- calculate_influence(gi_gamma_model)
plot_standardisation(gi_gamma, show_unstandardised = FALSE) # Clean standardised plot
}
