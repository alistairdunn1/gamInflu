\title{Geometric Mean}
\usage{
geometric_mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical. Should missing values be removed before calculation? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The geometric mean of the input vector. If non-positive values are present,
  issues a warning and returns the arithmetic mean as a fallback.
}
\description{
Calculate the geometric mean of a numeric vector, with robust handling of
  missing values and non-positive values. Essential for family-specific index calculations
  in gamma and log-normal models where multiplicative processes are expected.
}
\details{
The geometric mean is calculated as exp(mean(log(x))) and is appropriate for:
- Gamma family models with positive data
- Log-normal processes in fisheries CPUE standardisation
- Multiplicative effects and indices

When non-positive values are encountered, the function automatically falls back
to the arithmetic mean to ensure robust calculations across different data types.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage
geometric_mean(c(1, 2, 4, 8)) # Returns 2.83

# With zeros (falls back to arithmetic mean)
geometric_mean(c(0, 1, 2, 4)) # Warning + arithmetic mean

# In index calculations
index_values <- c(0.8, 1.2, 1.1, 0.9)
standardised <- index_values / geometric_mean(index_values)
}
