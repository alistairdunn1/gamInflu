\title{Stepwise Index Plot}
\usage{
plot_stepwise_index(obj, show_previous = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object containing calculated indices from `calculate_influence()`.}

\item{show_previous}{Logical; if TRUE, shows previous steps on each panel in colour with a legend,
allowing you to see how the index evolves as terms are added. If FALSE (default), shows only
the current step for each panel.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with stepwise index plots for each term added. The plot shows:
  - **Individual panels**: One for each term added to the model in sequence
  - **Index evolution**: How the focus term's index changes with each model term
  - **Reference line**: Horizontal dashed line at y=1 for relative comparison
  - **Colour coding**: (when show_previous=TRUE) Different colours for each step in the progression
}
\description{
Creates a step plot showing how the index for the focus term changes as each model
term is added sequentially. This visualisation helps understand the contribution of each term
to the final standardized index and works with all supported GLM families.
}
\details{
The stepwise index plot visualizes the model building process by showing how the focus term's
index changes as each term is sequentially added to the model. This helps identify:
- Which terms have the largest impact on the focus index
- Whether the index stabilizes or continues to change with additional terms
- The cumulative effect of model complexity on the final index

**Family Support:**
Works with all supported GLM families (Gaussian, binomial, gamma, Poisson) and uses
family-appropriate index calculations throughout the stepwise process.

**Panel Labels:**
The function uses step labels from the model when available, otherwise falls back to
term names. Labels are presented in the order terms appear in the original model formula.

# Basic stepwise plot
gi <- gam_influence(your_model, focus = "year")
gi <- calculate_influence(gi)
plot_stepwise_index(gi)

# Show progression with previous steps
plot_stepwise_index(gi, show_previous = TRUE)

# Through generic plot method
plot(gi, type = "step", show_previous = TRUE)
