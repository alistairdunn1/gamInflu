\title{Compare Focus Effects Across Groups}
\usage{
compare_focus_by_groups(model, focus, grouping_var, groups = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted GAM model object.}

\item{focus}{Character string specifying the focus term.}

\item{grouping_var}{Character string specifying the grouping variable.}

\item{groups}{Optional character vector of specific groups to analyze.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to analyze_focus_by_group.}
}
\value{
A gam_influence_comparison object.
}
\description{
A convenience wrapper for analyze_focus_by_group that provides a simpler interface
for common comparison scenarios.
}
\details{
This function extracts the formula and data from an existing fitted model
and performs grouped influence analysis. Useful when you have already fitted
a model and want to explore group-specific effects.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit full model first
mod <- gam(cpue ~ s(depth) + s(temperature) + year * area, data = fisheries_data)

# Compare year effects by area
comparison <- compare_focus_by_groups(mod, focus = "year", grouping_var = "area")
}
}
