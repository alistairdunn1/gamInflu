\title{Extract Standardised and Unstandardised Indices}
\usage{
extract_indices(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{gam_influence} object containing calculated indices from \code{calculate_influence()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{focus_term}{Name of the focus term (for reference)}
    \item{level}{The levels/values of the focus term}
    \item{unstandardised_index}{Raw aggregated values by focus level}
    \item{unstandardised_cv}{Coefficient of variation for unstandardised index}
    \item{index}{Model-adjusted values accounting for all terms}
    \item{se}{Standard error of standardised index (NA for log-transformed data)}
    \item{cv}{Coefficient of variation for standardised index}
    \item{lower_CI}{Lower confidence bound for standardised index}
    \item{upper_CI}{Upper confidence bound for standardised index}
  }
}
\description{
Extracts the standardised and unstandardised indices for the focus term as a data frame.
Works with all supported GLM families (Gaussian, binomial, gamma, Poisson) and returns the underlying
data used by \code{plot_standardisation()} for further analysis, export, or custom visualization.
}
\details{
This function provides programmatic access to the standardised and unstandardised indices
that are visualized in \code{plot_standardisation()}. The returned data frame contains the same
underlying data used for plotting but in a format suitable for further analysis, export,
or custom visualization.

\strong{Family-specific behaviour:}
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Gaussian}: Traditional CPUE-style indices with geometric/arithmetic mean aggregation
  \item \strong{Binomial}: Probability-based indices for presence/absence data
  \item \strong{Gamma}: Positive continuous indices using geometric mean methods
  \item \strong{Poisson}: Count-based indices with appropriate statistical methods
}

\strong{Log-transformed data handling:}
For log-transformed data (islog = TRUE), the coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated
in log space to provide meaningful measures of relative uncertainty. The standard
error (stan_se) is set to NA for log-transformed data as it is not interpretable on the
linear scale. Confidence intervals are calculated in log space and then exponentiated.

The confidence intervals reflect the uncertainty in the model predictions using the
confidence level specified in \code{calculate_influence()} (default 95%).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage
gi <- gam_influence(your_model, focus = "year")
gi <- calculate_influence(gi)
indices_df <- extract_indices(gi)

# View the results including CV information
print(indices_df)

# Check precision: lower CV indicates more precise estimates
summary(indices_df$cv)

# Identify years with high uncertainty (high CV)
high_cv_years <- indices_df[indices_df$cv > 0.2, ]

# Use with different families
# Binomial model
gi_binom <- calculate_influence(gi_binomial_model)
binom_indices <- extract_indices(gi_binom)

# Gamma model
gi_gamma <- calculate_influence(gi_gamma_model)
gamma_indices <- extract_indices(gi_gamma)

# Export to CSV including CV information
write.csv(indices_df, "focus_indices.csv", row.names = FALSE)
