\title{Step Plot for GAM Influence}
\usage{
plot_step(x, panels = TRUE, show_previous = TRUE, ncol = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A gam_influence object with calculations performed}

\item{panels}{Whether to use separate panels (TRUE) or single panel (FALSE)}

\item{show_previous}{Whether to show all previous steps as colour (TRUE).
This helps visualize the cumulative effect of adding each term.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns to use for the panels in the plot (default = 1)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Create a step plot showing how the parametric focus term changes as
smooth terms are added to the model. Each panel shows the cumulative
effect with all previous steps displayed as light gray reference lines.
}
\details{
When \code{show_previous = TRUE} (default), each panel shows:
\itemize{
  \item All previous model steps as colour lines
  \item Current step highlighted in black with larger points
  \item Reference line at y = 1 (no effect)
}
This visualization makes it easy to see how each additional term
affects the focus term estimates relative to simpler models.
