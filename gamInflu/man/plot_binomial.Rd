\usage{
plot_binomial(obj, confidence_level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object calculated for a binomial model.}

\item{confidence_level}{Numeric. Confidence level for confidence intervals (default 0.95).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing both observed proportions and predicted probabilities.
}
\description{
Creates a specialized plot for binomial models showing both raw proportions
and model predictions of positive outcomes by the focus term on the same plot.
}
\details{
This function is specifically designed for binomial models and creates a single plot
with two lines:

**Blue line (Observed)** - Shows the observed proportion of positive outcomes
(1s vs 0s) for each level of the focus term, with binomial confidence intervals.

**Red line (Predicted)** - Shows the model-predicted probabilities for each
level of the focus term, with confidence intervals based on prediction standard errors.

The function expects the response variable to be binary (0/1) or proportional (0-1).
For binary data, proportions are calculated automatically. The plot helps assess
how well the model captures the observed patterns in the data.

# Binomial model example
