\title{Perform influence calculations for a gam_influence object}
\usage{
\method{calculate_influence}{gam_influence}(obj, islog = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object.}

\item{islog}{Logical. Is the response variable log-transformed? If NULL (default),
the function infers this by checking if the response name starts with "log(".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
The `gam_influence` object, now containing a `calculated` list with data frames
  for indices, summary stats, influences, predictions, and s.e. of predictions.
}
\description{
This is the core function that computes all necessary metrics for the plots
and summaries. It calculates the unstandardised and standardised indices,
performs a step-wise model build to assess term contributions, and computes
influence statistics (overall and trend).
