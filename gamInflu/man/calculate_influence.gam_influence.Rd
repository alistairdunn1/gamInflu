\usage{
\method{calculate_influence}{gam_influence}(
  obj,
  islog = NULL,
  rescale_method = c("geometric_mean", "arithmetic_mean", "raw", "custom"),
  custom_rescale_value = 1,

\arguments{
\item{obj}{A `gam_influence` object.}

\item{islog}{Logical. Is the response variable log-transformed? If NULL (default),
the function infers this by checking if the response name starts with "log(" or model family.}

\item{rescale_method}{Character. How to rescale the indices. Options: "geometric_mean" (default),
"arithmetic_mean", "raw", or "custom".}

\item{custom_rescale_value}{Numeric. Custom rescaling value when rescale_method = "custom".}

\item{confidence_level}{Numeric. Confidence level for standardized index intervals (default 0.95).}

\item{family_method}{Character. How to handle different GLM families. Options: "auto" (default),
"gaussian", "binomial", "gamma", "poisson". When "auto", family is detected from model.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
The `gam_influence` object, now containing a `calculated` list with data frames
  for indices, summary stats, influences, predictions, and s.e. of predictions.
}
\description{
This is the core function that computes all necessary metrics for the plots
and summaries. It calculates the unstandardised and standardised indices,
performs a step-wise model build to assess term contributions, and computes
influence statistics (overall and trend). Enhanced with comprehensive support
for multiple GLM families including binomial, gamma, and Poisson distributions.
}
\details{
The influence calculation follows Bentley et al. (2012):
- Overall influence: exp(mean(|effects|)) - 1
- Trend influence: exp(cov(levels, effects)/var(levels)) - 1

**Enhanced Family Support:**

The package now supports multiple GLM families with family-specific index calculations:
- **Gaussian**: Traditional geometric mean for log-transformed data, arithmetic for linear
- **Binomial**: Proportion-based indices for presence/absence or binary data
- **Gamma**: Geometric mean aggregation for positive continuous data (biomass, CPUE)
- **Poisson**: Count-appropriate methods for abundance or catch numbers
- **Automatic Detection**: Family is auto-detected from model object when family_method="auto"

Each family uses statistically appropriate aggregation methods and handles edge cases
like zeros in count data or proportions in binomial models. The standardized index
uses model predictions with proper uncertainty quantification for all families.
