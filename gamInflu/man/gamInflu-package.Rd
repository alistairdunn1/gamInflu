\title{gamInflu: Influence Analysis for Generalized Additive Models}
\description{
Influence analysis tools for Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) fitted with mgcv. Supports smoother types including s(), te(), ti(), t2(), and by= terms. Generates stepwise index plots, term influence plots, and coefficient-distribution-influence (CDI) plots to help understand model structure and the influence of each term. This package is inspired by and builds upon concepts from Bentley, N.; Kendrick, T. H.; Starr, P. J.; Breen, P. A. Influence Plots and Metrics: Tools for Better Understanding Fisheries Catch-per-Unit-Effort Standardizations. ICES Journal of Marine Science 2012, 69(1), 84â€“88 pp.
